# ProductAPI
While I'm still learning the ins and outs of .NET 6, I decided to follow a few tutorials on creating a simple API in C#. In the code you'll find personal notes on how everything is working and/or connected. Swagger documentation was generated via the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package. The file structure/UML diagram was created for my own personal learning purposes.
